# marathonSplit

This app is used to help you hit a goal time in a marathon,
not by using GPS, but by tracking when you pass mile markers
and comparing against a plan.

Seconds remaining this lap, and the number of laps are displayed.
The ball around the outside makes 1 tour of the watch face per lap giving you a quick
way to check progress.

At the end of the race, a nice display showing planned vs actual times

The watch vibrates 40,20,10 and 0 seconds before the planned lap end time.
Pressing the lap button recalculates the projected finish time.
This is the time taken so far added to the planned time for the remaining laps.
Say you planned to take 40 mins to run 4 miles. At lap 2 the watch records you
have taken 15 mins, then the projected finish time is 35 mins.

The projected finish time is in minutes and seconds no hours - so the example
the projected finish time is 3 hr 14 min 2s
